            Kothis is a homebrewed setting, originally created for Dungeons &
            Dragons (5e). During the course of 2 campaigns there has been a lot
            of characters, lore, events, and even items that have been created.
            They all feel a part of this world and I want to include them all in
            a centralized place. This site will serve as the interactive
            connnection to the world of Kothis. Here you will be able to view
            your upcoming games set in this world, communicate with your party
            or GM, and even maintain your characters that live in this world!

            The amount of information you have available to you without
            requesting access is limited to the basic information about the
            world and D&D in general, but you can always request further access
            by joining a game or hosting one of your own! This world is ever
            expanding as we continue to play games within the setting. We hope
            to continue to grow the depth within the world with variety and
            interactions. It is because of this desire for depth (and an
            abundance of safety!) that we promote a safe environment in all of
            our games played within this setting. We have guidelines set up for
            anyone who wishes to join or create a game within the world that we
            ask that you follow. These are simple safety guidelines which amount
            to a good ole' fashioned "Don't be a d**k" rule of thumb. Respect
            your players and your Game Master and I'm sure everyone will enjoy
            their time in the world of Kothis!
